DO NOT bring forms to hospital with you on the day of your surgery. If you require a letter regarding your absence, please call our office (see <a href="contact.html">contact info</a>) and let us know what you require. This is not covered by OHIP and there will be a charge for this service. Our staff will call you when completed forms are ready for pick-up.  Payment is due at the time of pick-up (cash only as we do not have a debit/credit machine and we do not accept e-transfers or payment at a later date).  Please note that if you have not heard back from our office, your forms are not ready. The forms are usually completed by your surgeon AFTER your surgery has taken place.

If this is the case, please speak to one of our receptionists (see <a href="contact.html">contact info</a>). Operating room time is a valuable and limited resource. Last minute cancellations result in wasted operating room time which could have been used for another patient. Failure to provide the minimum notice will be subject to a late cancellation fee which will need to be paid before we can rebook your appointment.

                                            Your surgical follow-up appointment will take place in the Ambulatory Care Clinic at The Credit Valley Hospital. Usually this will take place 6 – 8 weeks post-surgery. This is ordered by your surgeon at the time of discharge. A staff member from the hospital clinic will call and/or mail you the appointment information. This may take a few days. Please note that each surgeon only has one half day clinic every week so there is little flexibility to re-schedule these appointments.
